This repo is related to my stackoverflow question found here
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12175491/getting-openxmlelements-between-commentrangestart-and-commentrangeend

This is the progress I have made after I initially posted the question with my main issues being with how fragile the code could potentially be.

Currently I am working on another though just around parsing the entire document and getting the changes that I want from that but it is still too rough to know if it is going to work at all.
